# WOW CD NOTIFIER SAMPLE SETTINGS AND DESCRIPTIONS
# Use this for reference, but put your actual settings in the main wow_cd_notifier_settings.txt file, not this one!
# A couple Notes:
# 1. Do not modify the section headers or anything before the equals (=) sign.
# 2. No Quotes or anything is needed around your settings. Just put it verbatim.
# 3. See Examples and if you have any questions, pop in the Discord Server here: https://discord.gg/m3kG5qbtvy
# 4. Make sure you also read the main instructions on the github site, as you also need the Weak Aura that goes along with this.
# 5. Reminder, don't actually use this file, put your settings in the one called: wow_cd_notifier_settings.txt

RealmNames = Whitemane

# Enter in the character name(s) to check for cooldowns

[DISCORD SETTINGS]

# Set your discord ID (not username) so the bot can DM you when your CD is ready according to your alert settings below.
# ie: 360129914808749710. You can get this yourself from your discord client, or when you request a token in the WoW CD Notifier discord server, it can be given to you then.
# Join the WoW CD Notifier Discord Server here: https://discord.gg/m3kG5qbtvy
DiscordId = 360129914808749710

# Upload file token. Unique for each user. Request one from the discord server: https://discord.gg/m3kG5qbtvy

[NOTIFICATION SETTINGS]

# Enter time (in minutes) for how far before your CD is ready to start alerting you.
# defailt is to alert 3 hrs before your CD is ready (180 min)
AlertTime     = 180

# how often do you want to keep being alerted? Setting this to True will keep alerting you every 'intervalTime'.
# (in minutes, lowest value is 10, and maximum would be the 'alertTime' you set above)
# ie: if 'alertTime' is set to 180 (3hrs) and you set this to 60 (1hr), you would receive an alert 3hrs before, then every hour after.
# set interval to True to enable or False to only alert once when the 'alertTime' is met. Default is False
Interval      = False
IntervalTime  = 60

# Continous alerting. Set 'keepBuggingMe' to True if you want an alert every set 'intervalTime' even after your cooldown is ready.
Will keep bugging you for each interval up to one day past it's CD.
# this requires that interval is set above to True. Default is False
KeepBuggingMe = False
